My first Repository
Hey, this is Praneeth. I am a high schooler, and I am really interested in learning more about proogramming, and in particular, how to use code in an actual program. I did learn basic python, but the few programs that I can make are basically worthless. I only learnt if-else statements, looping, and using pandas for dataframes and series. I am really looking forward to learning how to apply these, but that will take time. I hope that I can be a part of a community where I can grow my skills and prepare myself for the world.
